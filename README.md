This repository will be used to save my progress learning Clean Architecture design pattern.

The initial commit introduces the example taken from my [learning domain-driven-design-repository](https://github.com/vinisbitten/learning-domain-driven-design/tree/main/example). If you are utilizing this repository as a study resource, you can find a detailed explanation of the DDD example [here](https://github.com/vinisbitten/learning-domain-driven-design#p02).
